# Designo

### Figma-Style Design Editor using HTML, CSS & JavaScript (DOM)

Designo is a **Figma-style visual design editor** built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM)**.
The project focuses on understanding how modern design tools work internally by recreating their core features without using any external libraries, frameworks, Canvas API, SVG, or images.

## ✨ Project Description

This editor allows users to **create and manipulate shapes on a canvas** in a way similar to professional design tools. Users can select elements, move them around, resize, rotate, manage layers, edit properties, and export their designs.

The project was developed by first exploring Figma’s UI and behavior, then breaking the problem into smaller features and implementing them one by one. What initially felt complex became manageable through a structured and modular approach.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Builds the structure of the editor (toolbar, canvas, layers panel, properties panel)
* **CSS** – Styles the complete UI, shapes, resize handles, and a custom rotation icon using pure CSS
* **JavaScript (DOM)** – Handles all interactivity such as element creation, selection, drag, resize, rotate, layers, properties, save, load, and export

> No external libraries or frameworks were used.
